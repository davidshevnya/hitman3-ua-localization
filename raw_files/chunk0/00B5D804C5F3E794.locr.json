It's clear that McInnis, while he has great admiration for Knox, has a deep hatred toward his boss. Possibly fueled by an inferiority complex and an incident involving Knox \"rescuing\" McInnis from the Yakuza while working in Tokyo.

Por lo visto, «Florida Man» lo ha visto todo.

El diario es un tanto incoherente por momentos, ya que divaga sobre la genialidad de Knox pero, al mismo tiempo, se enfada por las decisiones que toma desde un punto de vista empresarial. Es evidente que McInnis, pese a admirar profundamente a Knox, siente un odio visceral hacia su jefe. Posiblemente, dicho odio venga derivado de un complejo de inferioridad y de un incidente en el que Knox «salvó» a McInnis de la yakuza cuando trabajaban en Tokio. Posiblemente, a McInnis le frustre el hecho de que Knox no haga más que sacar el tema.",
